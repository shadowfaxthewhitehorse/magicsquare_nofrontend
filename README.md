# magicsquare_nofrontend

In this project, we have developed code for the computer to build a nxn magic square.

The user enters the value of 'n' ('n' must be an odd number).

The program generates an nxn magic square for the given value of 'n'.
In a related project, we have created a program to create a magic square with a front-end (Technologies: Flask, Python).
